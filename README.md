The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a Python-based application designed to help businesses manage and track their inventory efficiently. This system enables users to add, edit, and delete product records, monitor stock levels, and generate detailed reports, including low-stock alerts and sales summaries.

The project is designed to address common inventory challenges, ensuring that products are always accounted for, reducing the chances of stockouts or overstocking. With an intuitive interface and powerful backend, this system streamlines the entire inventory management process.

Key Features:

*Product Management:

Add new products to the inventory.

Edit existing product details such as name, quantity, and price.

Delete products that are no longer in stock.


*Inventory Tracking:

Monitor stock levels in real-time.

Receive alerts when stock falls below a predefined threshold.


*Reporting:

Generate low-stock reports.

View detailed sales summaries and inventory movement.


*User Authentication:

Secure login system to ensure only authorized users can access or modify inventory.


*Data Validation:

Prevent incorrect data entry through robust input validation.

Ensure accurate tracking by validating quantities, prices, and product information.


*Graphical User Interface (GUI):

User-friendly interface built with Tkinter (or PyQt) for easy navigation.

Intuitive dashboards and forms to add, modify, or delete products.


*Scalability:

The system can handle large volumes of products and adapt as the business grows.

Easily customizable to fit the specific needs of different industries.

How It Works:

1. User Login: The system prompts for login credentials to ensure secure access.


2. Dashboard: Users are directed to the main dashboard, where key inventory metrics are displayed.


3. Product Management: Users can add new products by entering product details, including name, category, quantity, and price.


4. Stock Tracking: The system automatically updates inventory levels when products are added or sold.


5. Reporting: Users can generate and download reports to analyze stock levels and sales performance.


6. Low-Stock Alerts: A notification is triggered if product levels drop below the set threshold, ensuring timely restocking.
